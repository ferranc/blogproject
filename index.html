        <h1>What are they talking about?</h1>
        <p>Recently, Spaniards seems more conscious about the fact that what are our representatives talking about is not what is worrying them. In the next project we are going to compare what are the politicians debating about in the Congress and what are the Spaniards worried about. <br>  We know that there are a lot of open questions, unfortunately, we cannot answer all of them and we have to focus just in some of them. This are the ones we have choosen:
			<br>   -What worries more the Spanish citizens is what they talked about in the Congress?¿Or what is more debated in the Congress is what later worries more the citizens?
			<br>   -Do we have the same worries? How do they evolve?
			<br>   -What are they debating about?
			<br>   -Which political wing is more worried about current people concerns?
			<br>   -Is there any external element that can affect? </p>
